The rest is history. </p> </section> <section> <h2>Skills</h2> <p> <strong> Programming Languages: </strong> <br/> </p><div class="badges"> <span> C# </span> <span> C++ </span> <span> SQL </span> <span> Python </span> <span> HLSL </span> <span> GLSL </span> <span> HTML </span> <span> PHP </span> <span> CSS </span> <span> JS </span> </div> <p></p> <p> <strong> Graphics Libraries </strong> <br/> </p><div class="badges"> <span> SDL </span> <span> DirectX </span> </div> <p></p> <p> <strong> Game Engines and 3D Modelling Software: </strong> <br/> </p><div class="badges"> <span> Unity </span> <span> Unreal </span> <span> 3dsMax </span> <span> Adobe Substance3D </span> </div> <p></p> <p> <a id="cv-pdf" href="./documents/cv.pdf" target="_blank">Curriculum Vitae</a> </p> <p> </p><div class="socials"> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardo-rom/" target="_blank"> <img src="f00ba06e0ad6f3936c5b.png" alt="LinkedIn"> </a> <a href="mailto:bernardoreis2000@hotmail.com" target="_blank"> <img src="647bb52528e6a0ce522c.png" alt="Email"> </a> </div> <p></p> </section> <section class="right"> <h2>Released Projects</h2> <div class="personal-projects"> <a href="https://zin227.itch.io/fighting-game-tech-demo" target="_blank"> <div class="info"> <img src="b08f1b755ae915e737fe.png" alt="fg"> <span> Fighting Game Tech Demo </span> </div> <div class="description"> A Tech Demo and study of fighting game design, simple training mode with some settings for the user to experiment with. <br/> This was my University dissertation. </div> </a> </div> <div class="personal-projects"> <a href="https://mysteric-studios.itch.io/iskandar-the-spear-of-truth" target="_blank"> <div class="info"> <img src="e19a17b027acc7e2e1bf.png" alt="isk"> <span>Iskandar: The Spear of Truth</span> </div> <div class="description"> The game released by Mysteric Studios, a role-playing adventure game. <br/> My role in this project was Lead A.I.
